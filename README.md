# AUTOSAR DIO Driver

## Project Description

The AUTOSAR DIO Driver is a crucial software module designed to provide a standardized interface for digital input and output operations, following the AUTOSAR protocol. This driver is intended to be used in AUTOSAR-compliant automotive software systems, providing an essential abstraction layer for interacting with microcontroller GPIO pins. In addition to the static configuration, this readme introduces dynamic configurations using ARXML files generated by the AUTOSAR tool and highlights the integration of previously written Port and DIO drivers.

## Features

1. **Conformance to AUTOSAR Standard:** The AUTOSAR DIO Driver strictly adheres to the AUTOSAR standard, ensuring compatibility with AUTOSAR-compliant automotive systems.

2. **Abstraction of Microcontroller-Specific GPIO Configurations:** It provides a clean abstraction layer that insulates application software from the specifics of the underlying microcontroller's GPIO configurations.

3. **Support for Digital Input and Output Operations:** The driver supports a wide range of digital input and output operations, allowing seamless control of GPIO pins.

4. **Static and Dynamic Configuration:** While this readme primarily addresses static configurations, the driver can also be dynamically configured using ARXML files generated through AUTOSAR tools. This enables the driver to adapt to various microcontroller platforms and configurations.

## Static Configuration

The static configuration of the AUTOSAR DIO Driver involves setting up the driver's parameters and GPIO pin assignments in the source code or configuration files directly. Below are the key steps for a static configuration:

### 1. Integration of DIO and Port Drivers

Before configuring the DIO Driver, ensure that the Port Driver is integrated into your AUTOSAR-compliant system. The Port Driver enables the setup and management of microcontroller ports and pins. The integration should include relevant configuration files and driver initialization.

### 2. Include the DIO Driver Module

In your project, make sure that the DIO Driver module is included or linked appropriately. You will need to reference the DIO module's source code and associated header files.

### 3. Configuration Parameters

The static configuration of the DIO Driver typically involves specifying configuration parameters within the source code or configuration files. These parameters may include:

- Pin assignment to channels
- Initial pin values (input or output)
- Pin direction (input or output)
- Other specific hardware configurations

### 4. Initialization

In your application's initialization phase, make sure to initialize the DIO Driver module. This may involve configuring the pins according to the specified parameters and setting the initial pin states.

## Dynamic Configuration with ARXML Files

To achieve dynamic configuration of the AUTOSAR DIO Driver, follow these steps:

### 1. Generate ARXML Files

Use an AUTOSAR authoring tool to generate ARXML files. These files contain information about your microcontroller's configuration, including port and DIO pin mappings.

### 2. Import ARXML Files

Import the generated ARXML files into your AUTOSAR-compliant system. Ensure that the files correctly represent your microcontroller's configuration.

### 3. Utilize the AUTOSAR Configuration

The AUTOSAR tool-generated configuration can be used to configure the DIO Driver dynamically during runtime. The driver will adapt to the specific configuration provided in the ARXML files.

## Conclusion

The AUTOSAR DIO Driver offers a standardized and versatile solution for digital input and output operations in automotive software systems. Whether using static configurations in code or dynamic configurations through ARXML files, the DIO Driver simplifies GPIO interactions and ensures compliance with AUTOSAR standards.
